Spring Boot is the No 1 framework to build web application, REST API, microservices and full stack applications in the Java world today.

I'm Ranga Karanam. I'm the founder of in28minutes and creator of some of the world's most popular courses on Java, Spring Boot, Cloud and DevOps. I am certified on multiple clouds Azure, Google Cloud and eight of us, and I've helped more than a Million learners around the world acquire new technology skills.

I've been working with Spring Framework for the last 15 years. The first big change with spring framework is annotations. The next big revolution is Spring Boot. Within two years of its first release spring boot  has become the most popular framework to build web apps, REST API and microservices.

I'm a great believer that the best way to learn is by doing and we designed this course to be hands-on.

In this course, we take a deep dive into a spring boot.  At the beginning of the course you'd get a big picture of springboot in 10 small steps. After that we build a todo  management web application with springboot. We use spring boot starter web, starter security, and starter jpa to develop our web application.  In the advanced part of the course we will build a REST API for survey questionnaire with Spring Boot.

This course has more than 100 steps to help you become an expert on springboot.

All the details of the course the complete code examples and this step by step details are on our github repository. github.com/in28minutes/spring-boot- masterclass. 

At in28minutes, we ask ourselves one question every day how do we create more effective courses?

The success we have on Udemy with more than a MILLION learners is a result of this pursuit of excellence and this course is no exception.

We expect you to have good experience with Java.

## Course Intro

Welcome to this master class on spring boot. We are excited to help you build an awesome web application and a REST API with springboot.

In this video, we introduce you to the different sections of the course. By the end of this video you should have a clear idea of how to make the best use of this course.

We have organized this course into a number of different sections and we have designed each of these sections to be independent of each other.

That means you have the flexibility of customizing the course based on your skills and your immediate needs.

We have an introduction to the spring framework in the appendix at the end of the course. If you're new to spring or if you want to quickly revise the concepts of spring, we recommend you to start with that section first and then jump into introduction to spring boot.

Let's get a quick overview of some of the important sections:

Section 1 is the introduction section. That's where we are, right now.

Section 2 is a one hour introduction to spring boot. This section is designed for absolute beginners to Spring Boot. You will get a 10,000 feet overview of Spring Boot and some of its important features. As usual, as you expect in in28minutes courses, we take a hands-on approach to learn Spring Boot.

In Section 3, we build a web application end to end with Spring Boot in about 40 steps. You will learn about the fundamentals of building web applications with Spring Boot. You will also learn about Hibernate and JPA. By the end of this section, you will have built a full functional todo management app using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate and MySQL database.

At in 28 minutes we believe that unit testing is a very important skill for any developer.

Section 4 and section 5 provide quick introduction to Junit and Mockito. 

Section 6 is where we take a deep dive into spring boot. We try a variety of starter projects and build an API for a survey questionnaire.

If you are new to Spring, you can check out the Introduction to Spring section in the Appendix.

In summary, this is your course. Feel free to create your own path through it and tailor it for your needs.

I'll see you in the next video where we introduce you to our git hub repository.
